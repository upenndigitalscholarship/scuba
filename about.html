        <h2 class="about-subhead">Why SCUBA?</h2>
        <p>
          <span class="emphasis">The Big Thinking Reason</span>: To broaden the
          conversation about the role of libraries in scholarly communication
          and the technologies we use; to dream up as many great ideas as
          possible for how we might tackle a set of sticky problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="emphasis">The Practical Reason</span>: Most institutions
          are offering scholarly communications services, platforms, and tools,
          though the specifics are quite variable. Our needs overlap, but we
          often differ in our approaches and priorities. This is an opportune
          time to learn from one another.
        </p>

        <h2 class="about-subhead">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          SCUBA provides a kit that is designed to spark conversation across the
          library community. The kit includes:
        </p>
        <p>
          1) A set of group activity templates that local organizers can select
          from. These activity templates are designed to help people think
          creatively about the role of institutional repositories in the library
          landscape and to take practical steps to assess their own repositories
          and plan for changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          2) Instructions for planning a local SCUBA event, and for sharing the
          outcomes of that event with the broader community.
        </p>

        <h2 class="about-subhead">Planning an Event</h2>
        <p>
          <ul class="about-list">
            <li>Step 1: Determine the scope - who should be involved? What do you hope
                to accomplish?</li>
                <li>Step 2: Identify which activities you’ll do</li>
                <li>Step 3: Plan and hold the event and collect feedback</li>
                <li>Step 4: Refine feedback and report back to the larger community</li>
                <li>Step 5: Repeat as needed</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Local planning for SCUBA would begin with a group of people (likely
          from the same institution or consortium) getting together to do a
          small about of pre-work. They should identify a local goal and
          identify ways to get participants into the right frame of mind for
          this activity. The group should then select a sub-set of activities
          from the Box to work on together. After working on the activities, the
          group should continue their discussion and then report back to the
          larger community about what they learned and what their next steps
          will be. For larger events, a coordinator or coordinating committee
          might map out the event plans in advance and lead the larger group
          through.
        </p>

        <h2 class="about-subhead">Activities</h2>
        <p>
          The activities available will include options that will fall into one
          of three categories: Practical Activities, Dreamy Activities, and
          Conference Contributions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="emphasis">Practical Activities</span> are aimed at
          getting some of the “busy” work done that is needed to plan for
          changes to institutional repositories. These include writing
          institutional or platform profiles based on the templates we’ve
          developed for the Beprexit environmental scan, and defining scholarly
          communication terms for the larger community to encourage a shared
          understanding of the words we use as we discuss institutional
          repositories.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="emphasis">Dreamy Activities</span> will help communities
          think more broadly about what institutional repositories could be, and
          what they are missing. They will include activities for speculating
          about the possibilities at your institution, based on people and
          resources, and for creatively rethinking the scope and functions of
          your repository.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="emphasis">Conference Contributions</span> will also be
          welcome to expand the set of activities that make the kit.

        <h2 class="about-subhead">The Team</h2>
        <p>
          SCUBA and its core activities were originally conceived at the
          University of Pennsylvania, but we hope that it will ultimately be the
          product of the scholarly communications community, not a single
          university or group. We thank SPARC for their help in shaping the Box
          and providing support for its dissemination.
